# orbifold
An orbifold inspired UI for Mesos.

This is a fully customizable standalone UI for Mesos which Propagates metadata from Clusters, allows for Task execution, data persistence between sessions using cluster-store, and stylistic automation via Gulp in a dynamic UI which presents the User with an Alternative interface to Mesosphere.

The overall structure of 'Orbifold-UI' is dependent on the recent breakthroughs at Facebook React: We exploit this state-of-the-art 'stateful component' element 
which forces developers to compartmentalize, automate, and template using promises; masking or hashing functions which work efficiently on the DOM.

This entire project has been written for most modern browsers, thus exposing well-known practices in web-development. Further improvements shall concentrate on cryptographic concerns 
with data parsing and oversight(priviledges) between accounts. Threats in tokenized security issues dealing with cookies can enable MiTM Attacks and DDoS by spoofing the tubing. Thus said,
The ability to parse data structures via JSON makes for tidy workplaces: routes and end-points between meso-clusters and the end-user or admin, can only be implemented in what seems to be a reactive callback/feedback system of constant communication between scripts.
